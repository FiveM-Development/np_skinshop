## NP_SKINSHOP

This is a simple interface that allows the user to see thumb pictures of the clothes before applying them. This is just the interface basic implementation, if you want it to work with your framework you'll need to do some changes to the code. Anyways, this repo is no longer supported and any you'll need to solve any problems by yourself. Fell free to fork it and make your own version.

Ps. The CSS is garbage, I was still learning the basics when I built this, a refresh is higly recommended if you want it to look better or to have any responsiveness.
